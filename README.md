pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116   
``` 

## Running the code

### Model Training   
To train a model, modify the directory where you saved the data and the corresponding annotation file,  modify the model path directory where the trained model is saved, experiment with the different `hparams` values. Feel free to modify the code too. Execute this command to start training:   
  
```shell
python3 src/train.py
```
   
### Model Inference  
After training the model, modify the path of the test data and the model. You can execute this command to do inference:   
     
```shell
python3 src/inference.py
```
